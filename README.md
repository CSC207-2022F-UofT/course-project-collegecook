## Project Introduction
The specification of our software is to build a website that gives recipe suggestions based off on different criteria 
(ie. ingredients, cuisine preferences, time it takes, calories, etc.). Users can create, view, and rate 
recipes. The program provides the function of filtering recipes for users to conveniently search for recipes they 
are interested in. Users can also add recipes to their weekly meal plans, which include breakfast lunch and dinner options. 
Users can also follow and unfollow other users. There is also a profile for every registered user, keeping all their 
created and reviewed recipes and user information, such as age, height, weight and gender. The program also allows rankings 
of recipes based on the number of likes, number of comments, number of views and ratings. 


## Program Guideline
To run the program, just run CollegeCookApp.java.
